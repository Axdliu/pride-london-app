# Typeform -> Zapier -> Contentful Integration

As part of streamlining event submission we have built a typeform to accept events from the public. This has been integrated with Zapier in order to create a new event in Contentful upon submission. The `index.js` file here is the script used in the Zapier integration. It is only intended to create a draft event as some fields still need to be input manually via Contentful.
